# Motivation
The purpose of this repo was to create a tool with which   
someone can track easily changes of his favorite opensource repo

# More About: What Is Behind Of This Repo
I think that one way(among many others) to measure the programmer level - is by looking at his/her contributions to opensource.  

## Why?
* Because you actually can see the code he/she wrote not under pressure
* Because you actually can see he/she knows how to work with git
* Because for contirbuting to some popular repo you need to learn about project and its contributing-code in depth...

# But How To Become A Contributor?
One way - is to look on some opensource project you like, and try to understand it`s spirit  
That is why it may be important to follow the repo you-want-to-contribute closely

# Technologies
This project built with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) great library  
Also used [Jest](https://jestjs.io) library for running unit tests  
Also used [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) library for running visual tests

# Interesting Thing About Demo
The demo is hosted with free online [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io) editor  
Which can use also a free hosting platform for JS apps  
And also makes you able to build relative complicate apps without installing anything  
Which makes me to relate codesandbox - as editor of the future
